Creational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

                    1. The Factory Pattern: Making Potion Brewers
Scenario: In our magical world, we have different kinds of potion brewers: some brew healing potions, others brew invisibility potions. But instead of hardcoding how each potion is made, we'll use a Factory Pattern to dynamically create the right brewer!
                </section>
                <section>
                    2. The Strategy Pattern: Choosing Brewing Techniques
Scenario: Cats have different brewing styles! Some are patient and slow, while others boil the ingredients rapidly. We use the Strategy Pattern to allow our cats to choose their brewing technique based on the situation.

                <section>
                    3. The Builder Pattern: Crafting Potions with Ingredients
Scenario: Potions aren't made from a single ingredient. Cats have a list of magical ingredients, and they want to mix and match them to create their perfect potion! The Builder Pattern lets us construct potions step-by-step.
                </section>
                <section>
                    4. The Composite Pattern: Managing Potion Collections
Scenario: Our cats don't just brew one potionâ€”they need to manage a collection of potions. The Composite Pattern lets us group potions together and treat individual potions and collections uniformly.

                    Factory Pattern creates potion brewers.
Strategy Pattern decides how to brew potions (slow or fast).
Builder Pattern allows adding magical ingredients.
Composite Pattern lets cats brew multiple potions as a collection.
